First challenge is designing the screen template. After reviewing the Array and Matrix
Ruby Classes and discussing with mentor, figured that the basic screen structure can 
be represented using the array data structure. 

Array.new() creates an empty array. If you input an argument say Array.new(2), 
this creates a single array with two slot for elements [ , ].
We can use that fact to conceptualize how to designate the width of the screen. 
Further, if you specify Array.new(2, object), the result will be an array with two 
element slots that are filled by object copies. The object can be anything. 

Combining these concepts, we can create a container array that is filled with 
pixel arrays. Array.new(2, Array.new(#))

The first Array.new creates a container array with 2 element slots. Those
elements slots are then filled by another array that has # elements within it. 
[[ , , ,]
 [ , , ,]]
